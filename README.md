Free Code Camp-Front End Project 

I created this project by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript on Sublime Text.

I can see latitude-langitude and the weather using my current location with a different icon (e.g. snow,sun,sky) depending on the weather.
I can also choose in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit by buttons.
